# Brusselator-reaction-diffusion-2D
This project contains code to solve the 2D system of partial differential equations (PDEs) known as the "Brussellator reaction-diffusion" system. Various methods for both spatial and temporal discretization have been implemented. The system has been integrated for different initial conditions and alpha and beta values, commonly used in literature.
